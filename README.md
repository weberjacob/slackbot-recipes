## Slackbot Recipes
----------------------------

### What is it?
Just a little something that will take input from a Slack command, and add it to a Google Sheet.

### How to use it?
- Connect to slack with correct config variables.
- Once connected - how it's used here is with the [Slack slash command](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands) `/recipe`, which will prompt the user for a **title**, **link** and **category** and will then input those values into a Google spreadsheet from your config.
